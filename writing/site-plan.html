      <h3>Worldbuilding</h3>
      <hr>
      <h3>Dronik (Ringbearer)</h3>
      <p>Ringbearer takes place in a world named Dronik, where plants are red and civilization has crumbled. It’s like Horizon: Zero Dawn, except society collapsed long before modern technology existed.</p>
      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>Humanity used to thrive on Dronik until a time long ago when a force known as the Corruption gained control of the entire world. Its primary target was the magic users–Ringbearers and Giftcallers. Virtually all Ringbearers were destroyed, and the remaining Giftcallers went into hiding.</p>
      <p>Now all that’s left of society is a few shanty towns scattered across the land, struggling for survival while the Corruption is slowly choking out their resources.</p>
      <h4>Magic</h4>
      <p>Dronik has two primary magic systems: Ringbearing and Giftcalling. In the past, before the end of society, Ringbearers held massive power. Each one carried a wooden ring with arcane symbols etched into the wood. Each symbol allowed a Ringbearer to use a different power. Today Ringbearers are all but extinct.</p>
      <p>Giftcallers (also known as “Gifteds”) are more common but less powerful. Each Gifted is born with a Gift that grants them one singular ability. Some people, known as Gazers, have heightened senses and vision capabilities. Others, known as Cloakers, can teleport at will.</p>
      <p>It’s unknown how many types of Gifted there are. What is known is that each Gifted is hunted by the Corruption. For unknown reasons, the Corruption sends its servants to hunt and kill any Gifteds remaining on Dronik, seemingly in an attempt to wipe them out just as it did the Ringbearers.</p>
      <p>If the Corruption succeeds in killing a Gifted, they don’t merely die. Rather, they Fall, turning into dark servants of the Corruption. Many of the Corruption’s finest servants are former Giftcallers. Their unique abilities make them much more effective at tracking down other Gifteds.</p>
      <h4>Story</h4>
      <p>The general story of Ringbearer picks up thousands of years after society collapsed. In this time, knowledge of Giftcalling and Ringbearing has largely been forgotten. This all changes when a young man named Jedik finds a strange wooden ring in an abandoned shrine. This ring sets him on the path of becoming the first Ringbearer in thousands of years. Unfortunately, the Corruption isn’t too happy about this…and it’s determined to send its best servants to destroy Jedik and his friends.</p>
      <h4>Progress</h4>
      <p>As of yet, I’ve written nothing but a prologue and a few chapters for Ringbearer. It’s a complicated story, but it’s one I’m quite fond of, especially the prologue. It’s one of the few books of mine that I have somewhat plotted out, and I feel good about the overall tone and themes of the book. I don’t know whether this would be a series or a standalone.</p>

      <h3>Jedas (The Ice Mage)</h3>
      <p>One of my oldest stories is known as The Ice Mage, and it takes place in a world I’ve named “Jedas”. It’s probably the most Earthlike world I’ve written about so far, but with the worldbuilding it has, I believe it’s unique enough on its own.</p>
      <h4>Magic</h4>
      <p>Jedas is home to an elemental magic system called aura channeling. The premise is that there are five elements, Flame, Wind, Rain, Stone, and Frost. Each person who practices aura channeling (known as an auratic) has access to just one of those five elements.</p>
      <p>On Jedas, not all elements are commonly used everywhere. The most common type of auratic typically uses Flame or Wind. Rain and Stone are mildly common. Frost is exceedingly rare in certain parts of the world, save for one country: Tradza. Due to certain history behind this element, it’s highly feared among the general populous.</p>
      <h4>Story</h4>
      <p>The primary story of Jedas is called The Ice Mage, and it centers around a conflict between the nations of Unut and Tradza. The idea is that auratics with Frost powers haven’t been seen in Unut for decades, but have been seen everywhere in Tradza. The story kicks off when a young man from Unut, named Jonak, suddenly becomes a Frost auratic, out of nowhere. This throws him into a conflict that’s way above his understanding, during a time when he has to deal with severe internal struggles.</p>
      <h4>Progress</h4>
      <p>I will admit that this story is one of my weaker ones. Elemental magic has been overdone, and while I tried to make this system unique, it doesn’t quite work narratively. I’ve written a couple of short stories on Jedas that relate to The Ice Mage, but not much has come of it so far.</p>
      <h4>Worldbuilding</h4>
      <p>The one aspect of Jedas that does stand on its own is the worldbuilding. In the three and a half years since I first imagined this world, it’s undergone massive evolutions. I feel that I’ve fleshed out a lot of the cultures, history, and other lore of this world quite well so far. In addition, Jedas is home to my most fully-fledged conlang (constructed language), Kyeze. You can find a reference document for that <em>here.</em>[hyperlink to the conlang reference on the next page].</p>

      <h3>Vulcanica (Weather The Storm)</h3>
      <p>Vulcanica is a world of barren, volcanic rock. Across the landscapes of basalt, magma, and obsidian, tribes of humans struggle to survive.</p>
      <h4>Magic</h4>
      <p>The focal magic system of Vulcanica is called Stonecasting. Simply put, it’s a genetic ability that allows the user to manipulate stone to their will. The downside: when a Stonecaster channels their powers, a part of them temporarily turns into stone. The more magic they use, the more of their body becomes converted. This effect wears off eventually, but if it goes too far, it could lead a Stonecaster to become permanently trapped as a statue.</p>
      <h4>Story</h4>
      <p>Vulcanica is the first world in which I’ve published a story. Featured here and in the Written Works page is a short fiction piece titled, “Weather The Storm”. It follows three young adults as they practice with their powers and contemplate the looming threats of change and uncertainty. It’s a story I’m quite proud of, not in the least because I got it published in an anthology. If you’re interested, go ahead and give it a read-through. I think you’ll probably enjoy it.</p>
      <h4>Progress</h4>
      <p>I’m not certain where Vulcanica or Weather The Storm will be going from here. I’ve had the idea for a world of barren volcanic rock since 2022, but I haven’t ever come up with a good story hook. I’ve been workshopping different plot ideas that springboard off of Weather The Storm, but nothing much has come of it yet.</p>

      <h3>Minecraft Stories (Lost Realms, Dan and Karl, The Outerlands)</h3>
      <p>I’ve played Minecraft ever since I was a kid, and I’ve always had this sense of wonder with the unique world it’s created. That world has given rise to many story ideas, in varying stages of completion and quality.</p>
      <p>Minecraft-based fiction has been done before, but I’ve always found it lacking in realism and maturity. Most books published officially by Mojang are for middle-grade readers and are hard to enjoy as an adult. As of yet, I haven’t found a single written work of Minecraft-related fiction that holds the maturity and intensity of an adult fantasy novel. So my goal is to write one someday. And these next three stories are my best shot at that so far.</p>
      <h3>Lost Realms</h3>
      <h4>Story</h4>
      <p>Lost Realms is a story about a massive conflict between the Overworld and the Nether. The three main characters are small-time miners and explorers who get caught up in this conflict and discover massive secrets about their Minecraft world.</p>
      <p>One of those secrets revolves around the Prime Wither–a monster that the Piglins from the Nether are seeking to revive. The story is one of adventure, action, and mystery as the characters fight for the freedom of their world.</p>
      <h4>Magic</h4>
      <p>A lot of the magic in Lost Realms is directly taken from the magic we have in-game, but a lot of it is also more derived from that than anything else. My goal with Lost Realms is to push the boundaries of the type of magic that can be concocted in Minecraft.</p>
      <h4>Progress</h4>
      <p>This story is, by far, the longest-running project I’ve ever worked on. It started as a passion project between me and my siblings, back when we were children. Eventually, my siblings left the project behind and I decided to take it and run, adding new details and fleshing out the story so much that it became something completely new. I’ve never written a full draft of this story before, but I’ve never had so much of the plot written out and planned as I have now. What I do know is that someday, this story will be told. How that happens is up to fate.</p>

      <h3>Dan and Karl's Photo Album</h3>
      <h4>Story</h4>
      <p>Dan and Karl’s Photo Album is a laid-back collection of short stories and encounters within the Minecraft world. It follows a passionate photographer and his best friend, as they pack up their lives and explore what the open world has to offer.</p>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>I wrote my first Dan and Karl story as a short story prompt in 8th grade, and that was where the idea came for a collection of short Minecraft stories. In freshman year I wrote a couple more in-universe stories, and I really liked the idea. I don’t think any of the stories are good, which is why they’re not featured on this website. But someday I do want to write a full story collection.</p>

      <h3>The Outerlands</h3>
      <h4>Story</h4>
      <p>The Outerlands takes place in a Minecraft world where society has overcome the elements. In cities, mobs no longer spawn at night and civilization is able to move on without interference from the supernatural aspects of a normal Minecraft world. Outside those cities, however, lies a vast and untamed wilderness, still brimming with the magical phenomena of old.</p>
      <p>The Outerlands follows a cast of characters as they venture out from their city and into the wild, exploring every corner of the world they can. As they go on, however, they uncover deep secrets that change the very world as they know it.</p>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>The Outerlands was inspired by my desire to return to the roots of Minecraft gameplay. I wanted to show stories of normal Minecraft players doing normal Minecraft things, in a fresh narrative style. In a way, it was at first like Dan and Karl’s but as a continuous plotline. But then I got some ideas for more intricate lore. This was around the time I had discovered the Minecraft lore-crafting fanbase, and so I decided I’d try to build something up that followed the Minecraft lore as established by Mojang itself. When The Outerlands comes to fruition as a story, I’d like to think of it as more a fusion of Dan and Karl’s and Lost Realms, except with the lore of Lost Realms being much more grounded in what is actually possible in-game.</p>

        <h3>Written Works</h3>
      <p>
        I have a lot of ideas as a writer, but only a few have made it to written form. Here you’ll find a list of many of my current works and the ideas I have for each of them.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Weather The Storm
      </h4>
      <p>Weather The Storm is a ten-page short story. It details the life and reflections of three young adults as they practice their powers and contemplate the road ahead of them. In the Fall of 2024, this story was published in the BYU-Idaho Writing Center anthology Inkblot. In the future, I plan to extend this story into a short novel.</p>
      <h4>
        Ringbearer Prologue
      </h4>
      <p>This is the prologue to my favorite writing project of all time, Ringbearer. It opens with a mysterious character named Kagh Lefin, displaying his backstory and his actions as he tries to avoid capture by a deadly foe. This prologue was incredibly fun to write, and it will be extended into a full-length book sometime soon.</p>
      <h4>
        Call of Thunder
      </h4>
      <p>Call of Thunder is a short narrative story set in the world of my oldest writing project, The Ice Mage. It’s a short action piece about a skilled wind mage tracking a rogue frost mage through the streets of his home city. I’m only slightly proud of this story. It has its kinks and it comes from a writing project which, by my <em>previous admission</em>,[hyperlink to worldbuilding page] is quite flawed. Read it if you wish, but understand not everything in it is final or canonical.</p>
      <h4>
        Kyeze: A Language Reference
      </h4>
      <p>Rather than a written work, the following document is, in fact, a conlang reference. I became invested in constructed languages (or conlangs) when I was a sophomore in high school. This conlang, which I started before my junior year, became my junior Capstone project.</p>
      <p>Kyeze is used in the same world as The Ice Mage but in a completely different culture from what you see in the short stories. It is referenced in Call of Thunder, though.</p>
