                <h1>Dronik (Ringbearer)</h1>
                <p>Ringbearer is set in Dronik, a world where plants are red and civilization has crumbled. It’s like Horizon: Zero Dawn, except society collapsed long before modern technology existed.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Humanity used to thrive on Dronik until a long time ago when a force known as the Corruption gained control of the entire world, destroying all of society. Its primary target was the magic users–Ringbearers and Giftcallers. Virtually all Ringbearers were destroyed, and the remaining Giftcallers went into hiding.</p>
                <p>Now all that’s left of society is a few shanty towns scattered across the land, struggling for survival while the Corruption is slowly choking out their resources.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="dro-story">
                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>The general story of Ringbearer picks up thousands of years after society collapsed. In this time, knowledge of Giftcalling and Ringbearing has largely been forgotten. This all changes when a young man named Jedik finds a strange wooden ring in an abandoned shrine. This ring sets him on the path of becoming the first Ringbearer in thousands of years. Unfortunately, the Corruption isn’t too happy about this…and it’s determined to send its best servants to destroy Jedik and his friends.</p>

                <h2>Progress</h2>
                <p>As of yet, I’ve written nothing but a prologue and a few chapters for Ringbearer. It’s a complicated story, but it’s one I’m quite fond of, especially the prologue. It’s one of the few books of mine that I have somewhat plotted out, and I feel good about the overall tone and themes of the book. I don’t know whether this would be a series or a standalone.</p>

            <section id="dro-magic">
                <h2>Magic</h2>
                <p>Dronik has two primary magic systems: Ringbearing and Giftcalling. In the past, before the end of society, Ringbearers held massive power. Each one carried a wooden ring with arcane symbols etched into the wood. Each symbol allowed a Ringbearer to use a different power. Today Ringbearers are all but extinct.</p>
                <p>Giftcallers (also known as “Gifteds”) are more common but less powerful. Each Gifted is born with a Gift that grants them one singular ability. Some people, known as Gazers, have heightened senses and vision capabilities. Others, known as Cloakers, can teleport at will.</p>
                <p>It’s unknown how many types of Gifted there are. What is known is that each Gifted is hunted by the Corruption. For unknown reasons, the Corruption sends its servants to hunt and kill any Gifteds remaining on Dronik, seemingly in an attempt to wipe them out just as it did the Ringbearers.</p>
                <p>If the Corruption succeeds in killing a Gifted, they don’t merely die. Rather, they Fall, turning into dark servants of the Corruption. Many of the Corruption’s finest servants are former Giftcallers. Their unique abilities make them much more effective at tracking down other Gifteds.</p>

                <h1>Jedas (The Ice Mage)</h1>
                <p>One of my oldest stories is known as The Ice Mage, and it takes place in a world I’ve named “Jedas”. It’s probably the most Earthlike world I’ve written about so far, but with the worldbuilding it has, I believe it’s unique enough on its own.</p>
            </section>
        </div>
        <div id="jed-desc">
            <section id="jed-magic">
                <h2>Magic</h2>
                <p>Jedas is home to an elemental magic system called aura channeling. The premise is that there are five elements, Flame, Wind, Rain, Stone, and Frost. Each person who practices aura channeling (known as an auratic) has access to just one of those five elements.</p>
                <p>On Jedas, not all elements are commonly used everywhere. The most common type of auratic typically uses Flame or Wind. Rain and Stone are mildly common. Frost is exceedingly rare in certain parts of the world, save for one country: Tradza. Due to certain history behind this element, it’s highly feared among the general populous.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="jed-story">
                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>The primary story of Jedas is called The Ice Mage, and it centers around a conflict between the nations of Unut and Tradza. The idea is that auratics with Frost powers haven’t been seen in Unut for decades, but have been seen everywhere in Tradza. The story kicks off when a young man from Unut, named Jonak, suddenly becomes a Frost auratic, out of nowhere. This throws him into a conflict that’s way above his understanding, during a time when he has to deal with severe internal struggles.</p>

            <section id="jed-progress">
                <h2>Progress</h2>
                <p>I will admit that this story is one of my weaker ones. Elemental magic has been overdone, and while I tried to make this system unique, it doesn’t quite work narratively. I’ve written a couple of short stories on Jedas that relate to The Ice Mage, but not much has come of it so far.</p>

            <section id="jed-worldbuilding">
                <h2>Worldbuilding</h2>
                <p>The one aspect of Jedas that does stand on its own is the worldbuilding. In the three and a half years since I first imagined this world, it’s undergone massive evolutions. I feel that I’ve fleshed out a lot of the cultures, history, and other lore of this world quite well so far. In addition, Jedas is home to my most fully-fledged conlang (constructed language), Kyeze. You can find a reference document for that here.</p>

                <h2>Vulcanica (Weather The Storm)</h2>
                <p>Vulcanica is a world of barren, volcanic rock. Across the landscapes of basalt, magma, and obsidian, tribes of humans struggle to survive.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="vul-magic">
                <h2>Magic</h2>
                <p>The focal magic system of Vulcanica is called Stonecasting. Simply put, it’s a genetic ability that allows the user to manipulate stone to their will. The downside: when a Stonecaster channels their powers, a part of them temporarily turns into stone. The more magic they use, the more of their body becomes converted. This effect wears off eventually, but if it goes too far, it could lead a Stonecaster to become permanently trapped as a statue.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="vul-story">
                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>Vulcanica is the first world in which I’ve published a story. Featured here and in the Written Works page is a short fiction piece titled, “Weather The Storm”. It follows three young adults as they practice with their powers and contemplate the looming threats of change and uncertainty. It’s a story I’m quite proud of, not in the least because I got it published in an anthology. If you’re interested, go ahead and give it a read-through. I think you’ll probably enjoy it.</p>

                <h2>Progress</h2>
                <p>I’m not certain where Vulcanica or Weather The Storm will be going from here. I’ve had the idea for a world of barren volcanic rock since 2022, but I haven’t ever come up with a good story hook. I’ve been workshopping different plot ideas that springboard off of Weather The Storm, but nothing much has come of it yet.</p>
