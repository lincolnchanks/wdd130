                <h2>Weather The Storm</h2>
                <p>Weather The Storm is a ten-page short story. It details the life and reflections of three young adults as they practice their powers and contemplate the road ahead of them. In the Fall of 2024, this story was published in the BYU-Idaho Writing Center anthology Inkblot. In the future, I plan to extend this story into a short novel.</p>

                <h2>Ringbearer Prologue</h2>
                <p>This is the prologue to my favorite writing project of all time, Ringbearer. It opens with a mysterious character named Kagh Lefin, displaying his backstory and actions as he tries to avoid capture by a deadly foe.</p>
                <p>This prologue was incredibly fun to write, and it will be extended into a full-length book sometime soon.</p>

                <h2>Call of Thunder</h2>
                <p>Call of Thunder is a short narrative set in the world of my oldest writing project, The Ice Mage. It’s a short action piece about a skilled wind mage tracking a rogue frost mage through the streets of his home city.</p>
                <p>I’m only somewhat proud of this story. It has its kinks and comes from a writing project which, by my previous admission, is quite flawed. Read it if you wish, but understand not everything in it is final or canonical.</p>

                <h2>Kyeze: A Language Reference</h2>
                <p>The following document is a conlang reference rather than a written work. I became invested in constructed languages (or conlangs) when I was a sophomore in high school. This conlang, which I started before my junior year, became my junior Capstone project.</p>
                <p>Kyeze is used in the same world as The Ice Mage but in a completely different culture from that in the short stories. It is referenced in Call of Thunder, though.</p>
